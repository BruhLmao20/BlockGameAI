# BlockGameAI

This repository contains experiments related to a block puzzle game. Several scripts under `game-sim/` implement simple versions of the board and AI helpers.

## Setup

Before running any of the game scripts make sure the required Python packages are installed. Use `pip` with the provided requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

After installing the dependencies you can launch one of the game scripts. For example:

```bash
python game-sim/xonclick.py
```

Feel free to explore the other Python files in `game-sim/` and the rest of the project.
